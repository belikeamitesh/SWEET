## How to access our website

## Inspiration
In todays world, there are lot of sites solving problems related to women in any aspect tackling different issues. But there is no specific site where women can easily find everything related to immediate usage either be it medical or safety or social needs.

So thats where we came up tackling this issue and bringing these immedate necessities together on a single site - SWEET!

## What it does
SWEET is a place where you can have all the immediate necessities which are required by women and make it available easily to them ! We have currently tackled as many issues as we can and ended up brainstorming some important features in our project.

Firstly we have a medical section which includes the Medical section and the Consultation Section where a woman can consult her nearby doctor of choice Then they can message the doctor . If the doctor gives some medicines which she needs to take , then there is a nearby local stores section which has items which she can buy .

Secondly we have a social section which has an SOS feature which sends immediate messages to all contacts added when required for an emergency or when they lost their phone etc.. They can add contact to it.

We have tried our best to tackle lots of issues but there might be some parts left which we will be doing next in future.

## How we built it
Given the fact that everybody had a different set of expertise, some were comfortable only with backend and google cloud part whereas others worked mostly with Angular and Frontend part, It was difficult to shift from Angular to using React and learning new Techs.

We used github for collaboration , Reactjs for frontend and Twilio and Nodejs for sending messages. We also used firebase for messaging part and google maps for showing nearby facilities.

## Challenges we ran into
Firstly majority of the team never worked with React so making a project in react was fairly diffiult for us.
Secondly, team members being in different timezones was very difficult to connect with.
Coming up with such a great idea and communicating thoughrouly took a lot of time for us because majority of people spoke french and were beginners and one person only understood english and was experienced.
Accomplishments that we're proud of
Tackling all the issues mentioned above , we were abe to communicate and divide our work nicely and worked whole night waking up and collaborating on github
Had a lot of google meets deciding what to change or make on website and making it working.
One of the team member spoke french + english nicely which made our work lot easier to communicate and all memebers were comfortable collaborating and we finally made what we decided to make. this is what we are proud of.
Team members were very helpful throughout !
## What we learned
We learnt React, using google maps, using twilio and a lot of new things from this hackathon.
## What's next for SWEET
Will be making this website for public use and make people know more about the site and specially women for medical + social use.
